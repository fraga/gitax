GitAx
=====

Please keep in mind that in D365 F&O, development is 100% done within Visual Studio and we're all aware that VS already provides an out of box integration with Git.

This is an experimental project, bringing git for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2/R3. Started as a hack, might evolve to something useful.

Model
-----
Right now you can't just clone the repo and code in AX. Current version needs to be imported from a model. You can get the model from a list of [releases](https://github.com/fraga/gitax/releases)

Documentation
-------------
We have a small wiki [here](https://github.com/fraga/gitax/wiki) that will guide you building and contributing.
